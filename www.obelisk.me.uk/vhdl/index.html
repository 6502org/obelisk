    <h1>
        VHDL:
        Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        I've never been very good with a soldering iron but at the same time I've always
        wanted to understand electronics better, especially digital electronics . Early
        in 2004 I was surfing around cyberspace when I came across the home pages of someone
        who had built a Motorola 6809 based system running Flex using a Field Programmable
        Gate Array (FPGA). I was intrigued and decided to learn more about these devices
        and how you program them to simulate microprocessors.</p>
    <p>
        Since March 2004 I've been playing with VHDL. My initial experiments were too ambitious
        and recently I decided to go back to basics and simulate some simple logic components
        before attempting more complex devices (like the Intel 4004, MOS 6502, WDC 65C02
        and 65816).</p>
    <p>
        In January 2005 I finally bought a <a href="http://www.xess.com" target="_blank">XESS</a>
        XSA-3M1000 development board with 1,000,000 gate Spartan-3 FPGA but I'm still working
        on the VHDL model for my CPU.</p>
    <p>
        There is a lot of information about VHDL on the Internet but surprisingly few examples
        of simple designs for beginners so I've been downloading data sheets for CMOS and
        74 Series logic chips and working out how to code them. I use two development environments
        to check my models, the <a href="http://www.xilinx.com" target="_blank">Xilinx</a>
        ISE 6.3 (a free download but you need cable/DSL as it's huge) with ModelSim XE and
        <a href="http://www.gmvhdl.com" target="_blank">Green Mountain</a> DirectVHDL 1.1.2
        (reasonably priced for a beginner).</p>
    <p>
        I'm a professional software engineer by training and not an electronics engineer
        so it has taken me a while to get my head around differences between '0' and 'L'
        and propagation delays. If you have any comments on my models then drop me an <a
            href="mailto:andrew-AT-obelisk.demon.co.uk">e-mail</a> (removing the SPAM protection)
        and tell me what I've done wrong or how to improve them.</p>
    <p>
        In writing my models I've adopted a number of conventions, namely:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I write my VHDL in 'lower case' with 4 space tabs. If you don't like this then tough!
        </li>
        <li>I indicate active low signals by suffixing them with '_n' (as in 'clk_n'). </li>
        <li>I try to make my models work with '0', '1', 'L' and 'H' inputs. Outputs are normally
            '0' or '1'. </li>
        <li>My components uses generic constants to define 'High-to-Low' and 'Low-to-High' propagation
            times. In the models these&nbsp; time constants are zero but you can substitute
            real values when you create instances of them as components (see the test benches
            for examples).</li>
        <li>Lots of device names are not valid VHDL identifiers. I add an 'A' prefix to my model
            names (e.g. 4001B =&gt; A4001B).</li>
        <li>Some devices names include codes to indicate the technology they are manufactured
            with (e.g. 74LSxxx and 74HCxxx). This typically does not affect the function only
            its speed which in my models is determined at instantiation, so I put 'XX' in the
            device name (e.g. 74LS138 =&gt; A74XX138).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I only upload design files that compile and produce reasonable looking schematics,
        but if it doesn't have a test bench then its behaviour has not been fully tested.
        I'll be adding more designs and test benches over time so check back occasionally
        to see what's changed.</p>
    <p>
        <i>A word to students:</i></p>
    <p>
        <i>I don't mind you looking at my code to see how I wrote it but I wouldn't advise copying
            it verbatim and trying to pass it off as your own. If you found this page then your
            lecturer probably has too! Have an attempt at working out how to code a problem
            yourself first then compare it to mine.</i></p>
