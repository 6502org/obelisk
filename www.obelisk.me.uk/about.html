        About this Site</h1>
    <p>
        This site is the personal work of Andrew Jacobs. All the material was been lovingly
        researched and turned into fine tuned HTML by yours truly.</p>
    <p>
        I have no objection to people copying sections of the website to their local hard
        disk for personal use but anyone I catch republishing my work will be hung up by
        their short and curlies.</p>
    <h2>
        Why did you remove some of the pages?</h2>
    <p>
        I decided a few months ago that I was probably sharing a little too much on these pages
        so its been cut back to the sections that most visitors seem to like.</p>
    <h2>
        Why do you have advertising?</h2>
    <p>
        I have personally born all the costs of running this web-site for the last 15 years.
        It's become a teenager and I thought it was old enough to start dipping it's hand
        into its own pocket and re-embursing me for at least a portion of the monthly hosting
        costs.</p>
    <p>
        I'm giving Google Adsense a trial. I don't expect to be recieving $5000 cheques in
        the post anytime soon but its interesting to see how many people come to the site on
        a daily basis.</p>
