<h1>Programming</h1>
<p>This section contains information about programming in various languages
some obsolete or esoteric and others still very much alive.</p>
<p>Many software engineers beginning work today will only ever
work with high level, object oriented programming languages like
Java and C++. They will never know the deep joy (and massive frustration)
of taking on a microprocessor in the 'hand-to-hand' combat that
is assembly language programming.</p>
<p>It concerns me that some of the skills and tricks that where quite common place
    when I started my career as code monkey are completely
over looked today. Some of the forum posts I see by Computer Science and Electrical Enginering
students make me wonder if they still teach binary.</p>
<p>
    These pages contain descriptions of the processors and languages that I used
to program, or still do through emulation, and record some the
common techniques and tricks need to produce tight, compact code.</p>
