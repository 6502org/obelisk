		<H1>CESIL</H1>

        <p>Way back in the mists of time (or at least the late 1960's) someone
        decided that it would be a good idea for young and impressionable 'O'
        level computer science students to have a really simple programming
        language to cut their teeth on. And so CESIL was created.</p>
        <p>I seem to remember that CESIL stood for 'Computer Education in
        Schools Instructional Language' and that it was supported by ICL. It was
        a very simple assembly language supporting only integer operations and a
        little bit of string output. (<i>Sounds fun eh? Don't worry you'll get
        your chance later</i>.)</p>
        <p>If programming in CESIL wasn't challenging enough the act of
        actually running it added to the overall excitement. At the time very
        few schools had a computer that could run the code written by the
        students and the few that could had a teletype (a kind of very slow
        mechanical typewriter) connected to remote mainframe. Those of us
        without a teletype had to either write out out programs neatly on coding
        sheets or use optical cards (and a special black felt tip) to lay out
        our master pieces. Either way the teacher had to post them away and if
        you were lucky the results had come back a week later. Inevitably the
        first time you sent cards or coding sheets the result would be a listing
        of all the compilation errors in your code, fix these and if you're
        really lucky the next listing might actually have some execution output
        in it and then you could start debugging!</p>
        <h2>What does CESIL look like?</h2>
        <p>A CESIL program consists of two parts, the instruction code followed
        by a runtime data set. The instruction code laid out like an assembly
        language program with each line consisting of up to three parts namely a
        label (for lines that will be subsequently referenced by jumps), an
        instruction and an operand (which depends on the type of instruction).</p>
        <p>All memory, arithmetic and comparisons act on the current value of
        the integer accumulator. Named integer variables are used to store
        values when they are not being operated upon. </p>
        <p>The start of the runtime data section is identified by a percent
        character ('%') and followed by lines containing a single integer value.</p>
        <p>For example the following program totals the integers in runtime data
        section until it encounters a negative value and prints the total.</p>
        <pre>        LOAD    0
LOOP    STORE   TOTAL
        IN
        JINEG   DONE
        ADD     TOTAL
        JUMP    LOOP

DONE    PRINT   &quot;The total is: &quot;
        LOAD    TOTAL
        OUT
        LINE
        HALT

        %
        1
        2
        3
        -1</pre>
        <h2>Reference</h2>
        <p>CESIL doesn't have very many instructions and the previous example used
        most of them. The following sections give a complete reference of all
        the instructions I can remember. <i>(If I've missed any, or your memory
        is better than mine, then please let me know.)</i></p>
        <h3>Identifiers</h3>
        <p>In CESIL variables and labels are identified by alphanumeric symbols.
        The first character in an identifier must be a letter (e.g. 'a'-'z' or
        'A'-'Z') but any subsequent characters may be either letters or digits.
        The compiler is not case sensitive, it converts all identifiers and
        keywords to upper case during processing.</p>
        <h3>Labels</h3>
        <p>Any CESIL instruction may the labeled to indicate that it may be the
        target of a branch instruction elsewhere in the program. Instructions
        that are not labeled should be preceded by at least one space or TAB
        character. It is common practice to layout CESIL programs so the labels,
        instructions and operands are in three columns by using TAB characters
        to space them.</p>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>Lines beginning with an asterisk are considered comments and are
        ignored my the compiler, as are blank lines.</p>
        <h3>Memory Operations</h3>
        <p>LOAD <i>literal</i><br>
        LOAD <i>identifier</i></p>
        <p>Put the value specified by the operand (either a literal value or a
        stored named value) into the accumulator.</p>
        <p>STORE <i>identifier</i></p>
        <p>Copy the current value of the accumulator into the named storage
        location.</p>
        <p>IN</p>
        <p>Read the next value from the runtime data section into the
        accumulator.</p>
        <h3>Arithmetic Operations</h3>
        <p>Arithmetic operations apply a basic mathematical function to the
        integer value held in the accumulator.</p>
        <p>ADD <i>literal</i><br>
        ADD <i>identifier</i></p>
        <p>Adds the specified literal value or stored named value to the
        accumulator.</p>
        <p>SUBTRACT <i>literal</i><br>
        SUBTRACT <i>identifier</i></p>
        <p>Subtracts the specified literal value or stored named value from the
        accumulator.</p>
        <p>MULTIPLY <i>literal</i><br>
        MULTIPLY <i>identifier</i></p>
        <p>Multiplies the accumulator by the specified literal value or stored
        named value.</p>
        <p>DIVIDE <i>literal</i><br>
        DIVIDE <i>identifier</i></p>
        <p>Divides the accumulator by the specified literal value or stored
        named value. Dividing by zero will generate an error and halt execution.</p>
        <h3>Jump Operations</h3>
        <p>JUMP <i>label</i></p>
        <p>Causes an unconditional jump to the named label.</p>
        <p>JIZERO <i>label</i></p>
        <p>Jumps to the specified label if the current value of the accumulator
        is zero.</p>
        <p>JINEG <i>label</i></p>
        <p>Jumps to the specified label if the current value of the accumulator
        is negative.</p>
        <h3>Output Operations</h3>
        <p>PRINT <i>string</i></p>
        <p>Prints the string (e.g. &quot;Hello World&quot;) to the output
        stream. The cursor is left after the last character printed and does not
        move to a new line.</p>
        <p>OUT</p>
        <p>Prints the current value of the accumulator in a right justified
        field x characters wide. The cursor is left after the last character
        printed and does not move to a new line.</p>
        <p>LINE</p>
        <p>Moves the cursor to the start of a new line.</p>
        <h3>Control Operations</h3>
        <p>HALT</p>
        <p>Causes the execution of the current program to stop.</p>
        <h2>Visual CESIL</h2>
        <p>OK, now its your chance to try this wonderful language for yourself.
            (<i>Is that good news?</i>)
            Visual CESIL was originally written as an exercise in Java programming (in Visual J++)
            but Microsoft dropped support for this environment so I&#39;ve ported the code to C#
            and .Net 2.0.</p>
        <p><img border="0" src="cesil-ide.gif" alt="CESIL IDE Image" width="600" height="469"></p>
        <p>To get started with Visual CESIL you will need one of the following zip files
        which contains the IDE packaged as a standalone Windows .EXE and a few
        examples. Versions 1.1 and 1.2 need the Microsoft Java JVM to operate
        and may not work on newly installed machines. I've also made a command
        line version of the compiler and runtime which should work on any
        Java platform.</p>
