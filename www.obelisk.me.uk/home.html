    <h1>
        Welcome</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my personal web pages. It you're interested in the micro-processors,
        micro-controllers, retro-programming or electronics then you are in the right place.</p>
    <p>
        My old internet hosting company seems to have to decided to abandon 'consumer' web site
	hosting so I've bought my own hosting somewhere else. As a result my site has moved
	from www.obelisk.demon.co.uk to www.obelisk.me.uk.</p>

        What's New:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>02/02/18</b><p>
            I have started adding some Microchip PIC programming pages I originally hosted at
	    pic-projects.net (now defunct). The first two are on multi-byte <a href="pic/addsub.html">addition, subtraction</a>,
	    <a href="pic/incdec.html">increments and decrements</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>24/04/11</b><p>
            Some details of my Easter project to build a R6501 single board computer.
            Click <a href="electronics/R6501.html">here</a> for the details.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>20/06/10</b><p>
            A new version of the CESIL IDE coded in C# for .Net 2.0 has been released. You can
            experience the joy of CESIL programing under Microsoft Windows again. Click
            <a href="cesil/index.html#download">here</a> to get the latest files.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>27/03/09</b><p>
            Added some information about a couple electronics projects I've been working on,
            a <a href="electronics/miranda.html">Chess Computer</a> and a simple <a href="electronics/old-skool.html">
                BASIC Computer</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>22/01/08</b><p>
            The <a href="cesil/index.html">CESIL</a> compiler/interpreter is now available as
            a command line application base Java application.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>05/10/07</b><p>
            I've released a new version of my&nbsp; Java based relocatable macro assembler for
            the 6502/65C02/65816 on the 6502 <a href="6502/downloads.html">downloads</a> page.
            This update removes a few bugs, adds structured assembly programming and a librarian.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>03/09/06</b><p>
            San Bergmans (see <a href="http://www.sbprojects.com" target="_blank">http://www.sbprojects.com</a>)
            spotted a mistake in the <a href="65C02/index.html">65C02</a> reference pages where
            I had copied three STA instruction modes into the STZ description.&nbsp;I have also
            added a link to my own portable Java based relocatable macro assembler for the 6502/65C02/65816
            on the 6502 <a href="6502/downloads.html">downloads</a> page.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>21/08/06</b><p>
            Here's another simple MicroChip PIC based project. Its a another <a href="electronics/clock.html">
                clock</a> but this time with a binary LED display.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>20/04/06</b><p>
            Thought it was time for another update so I've documented another simple PIC project,
            this time a <a href="electronics/metronome.html">metronome</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>20/02/05</b><p>
            I've been playing with some simple electronics projects like my Son's <a href="electronics/alarm.html">
                alarm clock</a> and there have been some updates to the <a href="vhdl/index.html">VHDL</a>
            section.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>16/09/04</b><p>
            Added some information, links and resources on <a href="vhdl/index.html">VHDL programming</a>,
            including some models and test benches for simple CMOS logic devices. I would welcome
            feedback on my examples.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>25/03/04</b><p>
            Created a new set of <a href="65C02/index.html">65C02</a> processor reference pages
            based on the <a href="6502/index.html">6502</a> pages.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>22/09/03</b><p>
            I have updated the 6502 reference page to correct a mistake in the definition of
            the LDY abs,X instruction spotted by an eagle eyed 6502 emulator coder from Sweden.
            Thanks Hobbe.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>24/05/03</b><p>
            My <a href="cesil/index.html">CESIL</a> IDE has been further bug fixed and extended
            following some feedback from the Internet. The ZIP contains a couple of additional
            examples donated to the project.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>09/04/03</b><p>
            I found a few minor bugs in the <a href="cesil/index.html">CESIL</a> compiler while
            writing some new examples for Roman numeral conversion. The latest version is now
            available for downloading.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>12/03/03</b><p>
            I finally found the time and enthusiasm to finish my IDE for <a href="cesil/index.html">
                CESIL</a> and upload it to the website with a few examples. Download it and
            tell me what you think.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>09/11/02</b>
            <p>
                Added a new section on an ancient educational programming language called <a href="cesil/index.html">
                    CESIL</a> and have updated a few other bits of the site after joining the 6502
                Web Ring.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>31/12/01</b>
            <p>
                Added the first release of my guide to <a href="6502/index.html">6502 Assembly Language
                    Programming</a>. I still have some descriptions to complete for the more complicated
                algorithms but the main reference sections are ready.</p>
