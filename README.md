# Andrew Jacobs' Obelisk Website

Andrew Jacobs [passed away](http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?t=6466) on January 8, 2021.
This is a copy of Andrew's website, downloaded on February 2, 2021 before it went down.  It
was hosted at `www.obelisk.me.uk` and before that `www.obelisk.demon.co.uk`.  

Minimal changes have been made to allow it to be hosted on 6502.org: [http://6502.org/users/obelisk/](http://6502.org/users/obelisk/)
